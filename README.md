# Amerimanga2p0
The website promoting the rebirth and revolution of Amerimanga as an independent and self-contained medium with similarities to manga, but with important differences.

## What We're About
We believe that Amerimanga should not be seen as a negative thing, but rather as a term of endearment. For so long Amerimanga has been seen as a lesser form of manga that doesn't sell as much as Manga that originates in Japan. Part of our mission is to promote a global manga initiative that is about bringing positivity to the industry, rather than using it for reactionary and Trumpian purposes.

## Initial Goals
-- Promoting more diversity in art styles.<br />
-- Alternative means of syndication and self-promotion.<br />
-- The development of a self-contain culture and language, generally fictional languages not tied to any present culture.<br />
-- A charter against harassment like what has happened in previous twitter campaigns.<br />

## Develops Of A Conlang
You can find the conlang being developed here: [Fraponic Conlang](https://lwflouisa.github.io/FraponicConlang)
